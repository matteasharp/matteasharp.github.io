I have sat down to write this blog now three times. The first I wrote some notes about how social media and the speed of technology in general has caused us to engage with increasingly short and non-substantive forms of media. The second time I left those notes at home by accident, stared at the blank page for a while, and then gave up and switched to working on a larger piece I’ve been working on. And now, here we are. They say the third time’s the charm.

Between these attempts I have done a lot of thinking; why should we bring back blogs in 2025? And, more than that, if I can’t figure out what my argument is, should I even be making it? Is having a nice snappy title for my first post worth it if it comes at the cost of a substantive piece?

At the same time, if there was no reason to bring back blogs, I wouldn’t be doing it. Which is why today I decided ahead of time that when I sat down to finally work on this blog, I would be upfront about my challenges in writing it. Because the reasons I’m writing it have nothing to do with the specific point I am trying to make, nor do they have to do with my quality of research on the topic. I am choosing to bring back blogs this year for very simple reasons: I want to have a regular writing practice to watch myself improve, I enjoy sharing my thoughts on an array of topics but hate doing so on social media (god I miss school), and something good may come out of it.

My personal reasons for blogging mirror my opinions on why we should bring back blogging as a concept this year, so let’s get into it.

## Are Blogs Dead?
Let me be clear: blogging today is alive and well. But it is usually one piece of a larger puzzle - a way to drive website traffic or engage potential customers; the top of the sales funnel. My engagement with blogs generally occurs when I am looking for advice or researching a technical topic (some blog articles I have read lately are comprehensive overviews of EQing and compression in mixing). On the other hand, I often write blogs as part of my job in communications and digital solutions. Sometimes these blogs are technical how-to’s and sometimes they are more persuasive essay style, but the goal is always to either educate or shift the mindset of potential customers.

But the origins of blogging were less corporate and more personal; they were an outlet for people to share their observations, opinions, and analyses; a way to share knowledge with others without having to publish a book or academic article.

It’s not that the personal side to blogging is entirely gone, but more that article-style blogs are more popular than personal ones, and vlogs have (from my observations) overtaken personal blogs. When you can simply film your day and edit it then post it to a large audience (and maybe even get a sponsor to pay you for a shoutout), it seems antiquated and clunky to actually sit and write down your thoughts down. In a way, this makes blogging a form of resistance against the attention economy, but I’ll get into that more later. First, let’s talk about hobbies.

## Fewer Hobbies, More To Do
The decline of hobbies is a topic I could (and very well may) dedicate an entire blog to. For my purposes today, I’ll keep things concise: I believe many of us have lost the art of cultivating hobbies. We’re too busy, there’s always too much to do, and when we’re done with work we just want to sit and do nothing.

By nothing, we mean scroll. We want to mindlessly consume easy content until our brains feel better, but this causes a vicious cycle. As long as we’re consuming content in the form of social media, our brains will almost certainly feel worse. Life feels messy when you’re caught up in the hustle and bustle of 6 different apps and bombarded by thousands of opinions voiced by people who have no connection to us. To me, it feels like being pulled in a million directions, and none of those directions include cultivating skills that I wish I had.

Once it dawned on me that I had no true leisurely hobbies, I set out to change this. I have always loved writing, but I never really dedicated myself to it beyond school assignments - it just never felt like I had the energy or time. I have been almost entirely off social media for the past few months (though I try to check in once a week for messages), and to replace the scrolling time I’ve done a lot of reading. Some of those books have been about intentional living, which is how I realized that while my time is spent doing a lot, it’s not spent getting a lot done.
Which led me to hobbies. I make music, which takes a lot of my time outside of work, but I figured that to round out my efforts I should have one other hobby/project going on. So I picked up my laptop and decided to write.

Everyone can benefit from having a hobby or two outside of their day job. I think that my friends who work in the service industry have it right - go to work, get your tips, and pursue the things you enjoy outside of that. It can be hard to do that if your job feels more like a career, but it makes a big difference in your quality of life to invest in yourself outside of the office.

## Let’s Think Critically
As I briefly mentioned earlier, I see blogging as a form of resistance against attention economy giants like YouTube, TikTok, Twitter ( I refuse to call it X), or Instagram. If your blog is your primary platform to share and exchange thoughts and opinions, these social media platforms have much less hold over you.

Engaging with blogs flips the script: instead of going online and letting the topic of the day dictate what you engage with, you can decide what you’re interested in hearing about, then find opinions on the topic. Who cares what @bitxhghosts69 thinks about Wicked? What credibility do they have? Wouldn’t it be much nicer to find a film critic that you like and follow them to get reviews on the latest movies? They undoubtedly put much more thought into the review than a random social media user did, and you’ll probably get a whole lot more out of it. Plus, the critic’s post will have a lot less fighting in the comments section.

The problem is social media platforms encourage clicks, which encourages attention-grabbing statements, which encourages rage-baiting. So, while one could tweet something along the lines of “It’s so disappointing to see JK Rowling express such harmful views, I find it hard to even watch Harry Potter the same way anymore,” they would receive a lot more attention if they simply said “If you still watch Harry Potter you’re a bad person who supports bad people.” Unfortunately, this means you see a lot more of the latter.

Perhaps the most concerning trend to me is the pervasive online attitude that if someone takes issue with a part of your point, they actually disagree with your entire take and they’re wrong. End of discussion. No nuance is allowed, and no critical thinking is necessary - either you agree or you’re wrong and can unfollow me. This absolutism feels like a very slippery slope to me, and the ways in which it has leaked into the physical world (particularly in politics) is both disheartening and alarming.

Encouraging more thoughtful conversation and engagement via blogs is a simple but potentially powerful way to move beyond the one-sided takes found on social media and towards a more thoughtful and intentional way of communicating.

## Something Good Could Happen
My last argument as to why we should bring back blogs this year is simply that you never know what may happen. Maybe you start to really hit your stride and eventually write a piece that goes on to be featured in a magazine, or get scouted for your dream job by putting out an impressive article showcasing your expertise. Maybe your last blog of the year is a little more well-written than the first, or your sixth really resonates with one person who sends you a kind message.

Big or small, putting yourself out there has a way of coming back around. The chances of something bad happening are pretty slim - my bet is nobody will even find this blog for months (unless I promote it on my socials I suppose) - but the chances that a little bit of good will come out of it are quite high. Even if you blog for a full year and nobody reads it, you’ve proven to yourself that you can stick to something. You might have even crafted a bit of a routine for yourself.

## Closing Thoughts
I see the death of the blog as less of a result of social media-based interaction replacing it, and more as a symptom of our addiction to short-form, clickable content. That addiction has taken a lot from us - our hobbies, our energy, and our ability to engage critically. Bringing back blogs for the simple purpose of sharing our thoughts in a more comprehensible and constructive way can have impacts beyond what we expect. Already, I feel ever slightly more purposeful having set out an actionable goal for myself and achieving it. Whether nobody’s eyes but my own ever see this, or it somehow gains traction online, writing this blog will have been worth it simply as a practice in practice.
